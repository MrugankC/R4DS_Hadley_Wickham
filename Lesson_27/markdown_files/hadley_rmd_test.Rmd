```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r plot1, echo = TRUE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```


There are many diamonds less than 2.5 carats but they are concentrated around some numbers and not uniformly!


```{r number of rows in iris}
nrow(iris)
```


```{r number of column in iris}
ncol(iris)

```

```{r no name decided}

```
